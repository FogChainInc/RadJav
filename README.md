RadJav is an open source, easy-to-code JavaScript Virtual Machine and Decentralized Blockchain Datacenter. 
It is currently available for Windows, and HTML5. Linux and Mac will be supported sometime in July 2017. 
Android, iOS, and Windows Universal App support will come in future versions. RadJav allows developers to 
rapidly create and deploy GUI, server applications, make blockchain transactions, and execute decentralized 
applications. GUI and 3D Engine applications run with nearly the same performance and look across all platforms.
